# N-GIT
Website created using html, css and javaScript

N-GIT is a programming company from Bosnia & Hercegovina. For them, I made a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains pieces of information about them, 
few services that they provide, a location where are they located and form that you can ask them any question.

I divided the website into four parts: Home, About us, Services and Contact. 

A website is some type of landing page with functionality : 
- if you press any service it will appear border around that service
- when you fill out the form wrong it will appear red background of input and the user will be disabled to send email

Transitions are not made manually, I used the plugin whose link is below :
